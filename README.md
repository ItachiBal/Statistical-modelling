# Statistical-modelling
Various types of statistical models are implemented on realistic data samples

Here, our aim is to find out whether the reindeer can visualize the U.V rays exerted by the power lines(electricity). 
But it is already proven that the reindeer have the eyesight to see the UV light. 
So, we want to prove this using some statistical methods.

The data has a size of 357 rows and 28 columns when given. The data is available in the code section.

We have use the "Chi-square test of independence" to determine the hypothesis. Moreover, GLMS(generalized linear models) were used for statistical modelling.

It is statistically significant that there is a association between reindeer and high voltage powerlines.
